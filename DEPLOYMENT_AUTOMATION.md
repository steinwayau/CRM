# 🚀 Automated Deployment System

## **🎯 GOAL ACHIEVED**

The EPG CRM now has **fully automated deployment** - no more manual intervention required!

## **🔧 HOW IT WORKS**

### **1. GitHub Actions Workflow**
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Trigger**: Every push to `main` branch
- **Process**: Build → Test → Deploy to Vercel automatically

### **2. Deployment Script**
- **File**: `scripts/deploy.sh`
- **Purpose**: Agent can run this to deploy changes automatically
- **Features**: 
  - Auto-commits changes
  - Forces deployment trigger
  - Tests deployment success
  - Provides status updates

### **3. Enhanced Vercel Configuration**
- **File**: `vercel.json`
- **Features**:
  - GitHub integration enabled
  - Auto-deployment from main branch
  - Optimized function timeouts
  - Environment variables set

## **🤖 FOR THE AGENT**

### **Automatic Deployment Workflow**

When you make changes to the CRM:

1. **Make your code changes**
2. **Run the deployment script**:
   ```bash
   cd epg-crm
   ./scripts/deploy.sh
   ```
3. **Script handles everything**:
   - ✅ Commits changes
   - ✅ Pushes to GitHub
   - ✅ Triggers Vercel deployment
   - ✅ Tests deployment success
   - ✅ Confirms system is live

### **Quick Deploy Command**
```bash
# From the epg-crm directory:
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### **What the Script Does**
```
🚀 Starting automated deployment...
📝 Auto-committing changes...
📤 Pushing to GitHub...
🔄 Creating deployment trigger...
⏳ Waiting for deployment...
🧪 Testing deployment...
✅ SUCCESS: System is live!
```

## **🔍 MONITORING DEPLOYMENTS**

### **Automatic Checks**
The deployment script automatically:
- ✅ Verifies API endpoints are responding
- ✅ Tests email system configuration
- ✅ Confirms reminder system is operational
- ✅ Provides live URL status

### **Manual Verification**
