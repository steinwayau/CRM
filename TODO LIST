# TODO LIST — EPG CRM Comprehensive Audit

Last Updated: 2025-08-11
Owner: Current agent (handover)
Scope: Summarize editor progress and remaining tasks; flag current analytics issue for next agent

Canva-style Editor — Status
- Completed:
  - Zoom + Fit/Center controls (visual-only scaling wrapper); editing at 100% only
  - Alignment & Distribution actions; arrow-key nudge and Shift-nudge
  - Equal-gap indicators with snap tolerance and memory; button coverage improved
  - Rotation UX: larger handle + degree tooltip; snap angles
  - Multi-select (Shift-click) groundwork and marquee selection basics; selection visuals
  - Undo/Redo stack with keyboard shortcuts
  - Performance: spatial index for neighbor queries; rAF updates
  - Precision/pixel snapping on render (Math.round)
  - Exposed guide constants in `src/lib/editor-constants.ts`
  - Heading resize behavior: font scales when compressing

- Pending:
  1) Equal-gap: multi-gap visual (ticks + banner) and stricter snap precedence
  2) Rulers & draggable guides (top/left), snap-to-guide, toggle
  3) Canvas margins/safe-area and snapping awareness
  4) Properties panel fields: Opacity, Z-index, Lock Aspect
  5) Layers panel: rename, lock, hide, reorder; Bring/Send
  6) Grouping/ungrouping + align/distribute inside group; lock/hide on group members
  7) Constraints/pinning options per element
  8) Distance/redlining mode (hold Space) for neighbor/canvas measures
  9) High-contrast mode for guides/labels
  10) Keyboard shortcuts: Group/Ungroup, Esc cancel transform
  11) Text boxes: fixed width, auto-height; visual bounds in snap
  12) Help/shortcuts modal
  13) Text paste keeps formatting: preserve paragraphs, caps, line breaks on paste; add plain‑text vs keep‑format option
  14) Element copy/paste & duplicate: Cmd/Ctrl+C/V and Cmd/Ctrl+D; right‑click context menu (Duplicate/Copy/Paste); offset pasted clone; preserve z‑index
  15) Mobile text legibility: ensure minimum 16px font-size and comfortable line-height in mobile email render; Gmail‑safe fallbacks
  16) Unsubscribe footer alignment: center the unsubscribe block across clients (table layout + MSO)
  17) Branded signature block above unsubscribe: logo + company/phone + round social icons (FB/IG/YT) with links; config logo at `public/branding/logo.png`

Notes
- Editor code retained after analytics revert; no further editor changes pending analytics fix.
- Current Issue (critical): Dashboard campaign open/click rates not rendering; Analytics page enquiries are 0, but tracking exists in `email_tracking`. Next agent should reconcile data source for opens/clicks across UI.

Maintenance
- Audit existing editor items vs implementation; prune duplicates; mark truly “enterprise-level” items as Completed after verification.
