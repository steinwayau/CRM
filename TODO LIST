# TODO — Template Editor (Active Items Only)

Last Updated: 2025-08-14 (Golden State `8be163f`)

2) Undo/Redo support (robust history, keyboard shortcuts)

New items:
1. Display Name for sender: show “Steinway Galleries Australia” instead of noreply@steinway.com.au; add optional field in template editor to override sender display name per campaign.
2. Text formatting parity: Outlook and Apple Mail rendering does not match the editor/Gmail; investigate and normalize typography/line-height/paragraph spacing.
3. Customer emails performance: speed up initial load and avoid full reloads when switching between editor and campaigns; target sub-3s loads with incremental data fetch and state reuse.
4. When clicking any of the social media icons that are at the bottom of the footer they do not appear in any of the analytics. Anything that is clickable on the email even things like the social media icons which are hardcoded need to display in our analytics.
[Removed – Completed] Enter/new line behavior fixed; textareas now auto-grow and insert newlines at the caret position.
[Removed – Completed] Heading resize rule: edge handles adjust box only; corners scale font.
