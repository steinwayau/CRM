# TODO — Template Editor (Active Items Only)

Last Updated: 2025-08-15 (Golden State `ae7f9fd`)

1) Track clicks on hardcoded footer social icons (Facebook/Instagram/YouTube) in emails so they appear in analytics like other links and videos. Must be safe and cause zero regressions.
2) Fix dashboard metrics stuck on “Loading…” by ensuring analytics fetch runs on the Campaigns tab and always clears loading safely.
3) Ensure New Campaign modal always shows templates on first open by prefetching templates before rendering the dropdown.
4) Stabilize campaign status after send by using the server’s saved status and preventing stale refreshes from reverting to draft.
