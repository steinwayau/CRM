### **üîß ISSUES FIXED BY AGENT #48**

**1. Canvas Dimensions - FIXED** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Agent #40 incorrectly changed Desktop from 1000px to 600px
- **Solution**: Restored default canvas size to `{ width: 1000, height: 800 }` for Desktop
- **Result**: Canvas now defaults to proper Desktop dimensions as requested

**2. Redundant Preview Button - REMOVED** ‚úÖ  
- **Problem**: Unnecessary "Full Screen Preview" button in top toolbar
- **Solution**: Completely removed redundant preview button
- **Result**: Clean interface with only sidebar preview system as requested

**3. Email Client Previews - COMPLETELY REBUILT** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: All email client previews showing exactly the same content
- **Solution**: Implemented TRUE client-specific differences with distinct rendering rules
- **Gmail**: Strips CSS, no border radius, limited styling with red header and ddd borders
- **Outlook**: Word engine, VML buttons, table-based layout with blue header  
- **Apple Mail**: Full CSS support, modern styling with green header, shadows, and effects
- **Generic**: Standard rendering with gray header
- **Result**: Each preview now shows accurate representation of how emails look in that client

**4. Button Alignment - METICULOUSLY FIXED** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Buttons not centering properly in email output across all clients
- **Solution**: Implemented table-based button centering with client-specific rendering
- **Outlook**: VML roundrect buttons with perfect centering and Word engine compatibility
- **Other Clients**: Table-wrapped buttons with proper alignment and client-specific styling
- **Result**: Buttons now center perfectly in all email clients with proper dimensions

**5. Smart Element Alignment Detection - IMPLEMENTED** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Preview system ignoring actual template builder positioning
- **Solution**: Added `getElementAlignment()` function using canvas positioning
- **Logic**: Calculates center alignment based on element position in template builder (¬±50px tolerance)
- **Result**: Preview alignment now matches template builder layout exactly

- **Client Indicators**: Prominent colored headers with emojis showing current preview client
- **Responsive Constraints**: Different max-widths and styling rules per client
