# TODO LIST — EPG CRM Comprehensive Audit

Last Updated: 2025-08-10
Owner: Current agent (investigation-only)
Scope: Read-only audit; no code changes or deployments performed

Canva-style Editor — Remaining Tasks (simple, numbered)
1) Best-in-class resize snapping: moving edge snaps to neighbor edges/centers; anchor edge fixed; show single guide + pixel label per axis.
2) Equal-gap polish: dual labels (left/right or top/bottom) with fade; snap when gaps equal within tolerance; suppress at low zoom.
3) Zoom + Fit/Center controls: 50/75/100/125% with visual-only scaling; editing enabled only at 100%; Fit-to-window and Center canvas.
4) Alignment & Distribution panel: Align Left/Right/Top/Bottom/Vertical Center/Horizontal Center; Distribute with equal gap (respect locked).
5) Rulers & draggable guides: top/left rulers with draggable guide lines; snap-to-guide; toggle; density auto at zoom.
6) Canvas margins/safe-area: configurable margins/bleed; guides appear; snapping respects them.
7) Properties panel fields: Rotation (done), add Opacity, Z-index, Lock Aspect toggle; live numeric editing with undo/redo.
8) Grouping and multi-select: marquee/Shift-click; group bounds snapping; align/distribute inside group; lock/hide on group members.
9) Layers panel: rename, lock, hide, reorder; Bring to Front/Back and Step Forward/Back.
10) Constraints (pinning): pin to top/left/right/bottom; scale with canvas; fixed size; predictable behavior on canvas resize.
11) Distance/redlining mode: while dragging or holding Space, show redline measurements to nearest neighbors and canvas edges.
12) Rotation UX polish: larger handle target, degree ring at hover, configurable snap angles.
13) High-contrast mode: toggle increases guide/label contrast and thickness for accessibility.
14) Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd/Ctrl disable snap (done), Arrows/Shift (done), Alt-drag duplicate (done); add: Cmd/Ctrl+G group, Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+G ungroup, Esc cancel transform.
15) Undo/Redo stack: capture all transforms and property edits; Ctrl/Cmd+Z / Shift+Z.
16) Performance: spatial index (quadtree/R-tree) for nearest-neighbor queries; cache bounds; rAF-only updates; avoid layout thrash.
17) Precision/pixel snapping: store sub-pixel state but render snapped to whole pixels to avoid blur; text boxes prefer integer sizes.
18) Guide engine config: expose constants (SNAP_TOLERANCE, BIG_NUDGE, ROTATE_SNAP_DEGREES, GUIDE_FADE_MS, MAX_NEIGHBORS_FOR_SNAP) with comments.
19) Resize behavior for text boxes: fixed width, auto-height; snapping/measurement uses visual bounds.
20) Help/shortcuts modal: quick reference for guides, snapping rules, and shortcuts.

Other Open Items (non-Canva)
A1) Resend webhooks TODOs (8 items): status/delivery/bounce/complaint/open/click logging — implement after analytics model finalised.
A2) Email analytics route TODO: confirm relevance post-latest schema; clean up or complete behaviour accordingly.
A3) Preview placeholder links: change `href="#"` behaviour in preview-only context to prevent scrolling (minor polish).
A4) `scripts/test-urls.sh` BASE_URL: update legacy domain reference (doc utility only).
A5) Error surfacing pass: ensure critical throws in admin flows surface as user-friendly toasts (import/template/campaign).

Notes
- Production deploys auto-trigger from GitHub main; hard-refresh after deploy to clear cached assets.
