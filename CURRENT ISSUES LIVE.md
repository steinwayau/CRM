# CURRENT ISSUES (Updated by Agent)

Date: 2025-08-16
Environment: Production (crm.steinway.com.au)
Golden State: `726d9b4`

## ✅ Resolved since last update
- Email dashboard metrics stuck on “Loading…” fixed. Tiles now load on Campaigns tab with safe background analytics.
- "New Campaign" modal templates dropdown now populated on first open (prefetch).
- Persistent "sending now" status after successful send fixed (functional state updates + immediate safe refresh).
- Action History panel labels/coalescing fixed; history now shows clear, single entries per action.

## 🔧 Remaining / New items (source of truth: `TODO LIST`)
1) Add bulk delete for campaigns: select multiple/all and delete with confirmation.
2) Fix Create Campaign modal on smaller screens: modal body must scroll and the “Create Campaign” button stay reachable (sticky footer or internal scroll).
