# TODO — Template Editor (Active Items Only)

Last Updated: 2025-08-16 (Golden State `726d9b4`)

1) Add bulk delete for campaigns: allow selecting multiple (or all) campaigns and delete selected with a single action (with confirmation).
2) Fix Create Campaign modal on smaller screens: ensure the modal body scrolls and the “Create Campaign” button is always reachable (sticky footer or internal scroll).
