# TODO — Template Editor (Active Items Only)

Last Updated: 2025-08-14 (Golden State `fb14a2c`)

2) Undo/Redo support (robust history, keyboard shortcuts)

New items:
[Removed – Completed] Sender display name: shows “Steinway Galleries Australia” by default; optional per-campaign override supported.
[Removed – Completed] Outlook/Apple Mail formatting parity: standardized inline CSS and paragraph handling in standard generator.
3. Customer emails performance: speed up initial load and avoid full reloads when switching between editor and campaigns; target sub-3s loads with incremental data fetch and state reuse.
4. When clicking any of the social media icons that are at the bottom of the footer they do not appear in any of the analytics. Anything that is clickable on the email even things like the social media icons which are hardcoded need to display in our analytics.
[Removed – Completed] Enter/new line behavior fixed; textareas now auto-grow and insert newlines at the caret position.
[Removed – Completed] Heading resize rule: edge handles adjust box only; corners scale font.
