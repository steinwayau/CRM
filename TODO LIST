1) Add bulk delete for campaigns: allow selecting multiple (or all) campaigns and delete selected with a single action (with confirmation).
2) Show live recipient count in the New Campaign filter panel (inside “Customer Filters”) as filters are adjusted, so the user can see how many recipients will be targeted before applying.
