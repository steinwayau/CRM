## 🛡️ **WHAT NOT TO BREAK - CRITICAL WARNING FOR FUTURE AGENTS**

### **❌ DO NOT TOUCH THESE WORKING SYSTEMS:**
1. **Email Analytics API** (`/api/email/analytics`) - Click-based logic is perfect

3. **Campaign Modal Logic** - Analytics persistence fix is delicate
4. **Tab Navigation** - URL parameter system is working correctly
5. **Email Sending Flow** - Campaign creation and sending is stable

### **⚠️ HIGH-RISK AREAS:**
- **Analytics Calculations** - Click-based open logic is precisely tuned
- **Real-Time Broadcasting** - Pusher events must not be modified
- **Modal State Management** - ViewingCampaign and DetailedAnalytics coordination
- **URL Search Parameters** - Tab persistence depends on exact implementation
