1) Text paste behavior: paste from Google Docs/Word into text/heading and keep basic formatting (bold, italic, underline, links, lists, line breaks); support Cmd/Ctrl+V in canvas and right panel; auto‑expand text boxes to fit
2) Undo/Redo support (robust history, keyboard shortcuts)
3) Canva‑style corner drag: snap element edges precisely to canvas top/left/right/bottom when resizing from corners
